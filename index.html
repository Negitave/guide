    <p>This is a page where you copy my settings, get the software I use, etc.</p>

    <p3>A little about pvp. it's a Player Vs Player type of gamemode related into such as pots or soup. It could almost be normal though. A way to get someone in a combo is w-tapping. When you do it correctly you can do some insane things!</p3>
